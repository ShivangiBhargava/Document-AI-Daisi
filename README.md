# Document-AI-Daisi
Extract useful information from text using Python and Machine Learning.
Searching through text is one of the key focus areas of Machine Learning Applications in the field of Natural Language.

But what if we have to search for multiple keywords from a large document (100+ pages). Also, what if we have do a contextual search (searching for similar meaning keywords) with in our document! — The conventional ‘CTRL + F’ solution would either take long long hours to accomplish this task (or in case of contextual search, it will not be able to find any meaning text).

So this daisi is created ML based Python program for performing search through any text.
