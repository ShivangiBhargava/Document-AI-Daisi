        Intelligent Document Search App is related to Natural Language Processing: 
        Intelligent Search through text using Spacy and Python.
        
       ➔ Extract useful information from text using Python and Machine Learning

       👈Searching through text is one of the key focus area of Machine Learning Applications in the field of Natural Language..!

       ### ➔ But what if we have to search for multiple keywords from a large document (100+ pages).💡💭
       ### ➔ Also, what if we have do a contextual search (searching for similar meaning keywords) with in our document!🤔


       - The conventional ‘CTRL + F’ solution would either take long long hours to accomplish this task (or in case of contextual search, it will not be able to find any meaning text)..
     
       ### That’s why this project will be very useful❤️!!
